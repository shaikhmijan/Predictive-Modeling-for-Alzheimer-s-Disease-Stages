# Predictive-Modeling-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Stages
This project aims to analyze MRI image data to predict the stage of Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of creating a highly accurate model. By leveraging meticulously collected and verified data, the results will help in early diagnosis and treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
# Problem Statement:
Background: Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease stages is crucial for timely and
effective treatment, reducing patient suffering and healthcare costs.
Objective: Develop a predictive model to accurately determine the stage of Alzheimer's disease.
Scope: Focus on four classes of MRI images: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, NonDemented, and Very Mild Demented.
# Data Sources:
Primary Data: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ch87yswbz4/1
Secondary Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-ofimages
# Methodology:
Data Collection: Utilize hand-collected and verified MRI images from various online sources.
Data Preparation: Clean and prepare the data, handling missing values and standardizing
formats.
